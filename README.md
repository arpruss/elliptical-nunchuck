This doesn't really work. :-(
It ran for a bit on my digispark knockoff, and then failed spectacularly and smokily:
The digispark was burned out. And Windows warned about a surge on the USB port. I had to
reboot the computer to get the USB port working again.

The code might be useful for someone, though. I plan to port it to stm32 and see if it works.
I have a hunch that the problems had some connection to the fact that the Nunchuck is designed
for 3.3V and the Digispark runs at 5V.
